Escaping the Cult of Mac: A Guide from a Cult Survivor

This is a fun short book project that came about as a result of a conversation with my local Linux community.
Basically, we were poking fun at a Cult of Mac member in our group, and he said "I could write the book on the cult!"
To which I replied, "Firstly, you're not an accomplished author. Secondly, as a cult survivor, I'm the one who should be writing the book."
A few drinks later, and here I am writing this damn book over the course of a weekend where it's -16 degrees Celcius outside, and snowy.
At least it's funny as hell. And true.
