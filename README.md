Escaping the Cult of Mac: A Guide from a Cult Survivor (Revised October 2020)

This is a fun short book project that came about as a result of a conversation with my local Linux/UNIX/developer/IT community back in January 2019.

At one point during the night, we were sitting at a round booth and poking fun at a total Apple fanboy in our group. 
Someone called him a “Cult of Mac member” and he replied, “And proud to be one - I could write the book on the cult!” to which I replied, “Firstly, you're not an accomplished author. Secondly, as a cult survivor, I'm the one who should be writing the book.” 

A few drinks later, I somehow got roped into making a bet that I could write a proper book on the Cult of Mac in a weekend. So I did. 
It’s called Escaping the Cult of Mac: A Guide from a Cult Survivor.

I've revised it three times: May 2019 (reader contributions), May 2020 (new info and reader contributions) & October 2020 (new info).

The current version is 78 pages long.

Anywho, it’s true, it’s funny, and it’s worth a read.

Most reactions so far have been “The was freakin’ hilarious, and so very very true!”

But remember that it's also satire (not politically correct), and should be treated as such (no haters please).

While entirely unnecessary, if you enjoyed what I wrote and want to show your appreciation - send me an email to let me know what you thought of it! Or buy me a coffee (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jasoneckert). I'm just glad you read it. 

Cheers!
