Escaping the Cult of Mac: A Guide from a Cult Survivor

This is a fun short book project that came about as a result of a conversation with my local Linux/UNIX/developer/IT community.

At one point during the night, we were sitting at a round booth and poking fun at a total Apple fanboy in our group. Someone called him a “Cult of Mac member” and he replied, “And proud to be one - I could write the book on the cult!” to which I replied, “Firstly, you're not an accomplished author. Secondly, as a cult survivor, I'm the one who should be writing the book.” 

A few drinks later, I somehow got roped into making a bet that I could write a proper book on the Cult of Mac in a weekend. So I did. 
It’s called Escaping the Cult of Mac: A Guide from a Cult Survivor.
The current version is 76 pages long.

Anywho, it’s true, it’s funny, and it’s worth a read.
But remember that it's satire, and should be treated as such (no haters please).
